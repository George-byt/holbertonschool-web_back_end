## Personally identifiable information **(PII)**

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identify, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

## non-Personally identifiable information **(non-PII)**

Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is data that cannot be used on its own to trace, or identify a person. Examples of non-PII include, but are not limited to:
* Aggregated statistics on the use of product / service
* Partially or fully masked IP addresses
